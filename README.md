> **Mixeway Flow** integrates security into your SDLC from day one. It aggregates results from built-in scanners, hooks seamlessly into Git (webhooks), and presents everything in a single, actionable dashboard.
>
> **Under Development:** we are building an AI/LLM-powered verification engine that combines detected findings with extended vulnerability intelligence and then **verifies, in your own source code, whether a specific vulnerability is truly present and exploitable**. The goal is to deliver **100% accurate, properly prioritized information** for engineers and security teams. This feature will be available in a **future release** (see the details below).

Available demonstration: https://flow.mixeway.io

## Why Mixeway Flow?

- **One dashboard to rule them all** ‚Äî SAST, SCA, IaC, and secret scanning in one place.
- **Zero CI friction** ‚Äî Git webhooks trigger scans automatically; no complex pipeline wiring needed.
- **Focus on what matters** ‚Äî Suppress/ignore by context to cut noise and prioritize real risk.
- **Fast time-to-value** ‚Äî Docker Compose install; be up and reviewing findings in minutes.
- **Built for the next step** ‚Äî Designed to plug in an AI/LLM verification layer that validates exploitability directly in your codebase.

---

## How it Works

![Process](.github/img/flow_process.jpg)

1. **Register a Git repository** (URL + access token). An initial scan runs on the latest commit of the default branch.
2. **Configure a webhook** (GitHub/GitLab). Each push or PR/MR triggers a scan; events are queued if needed.
3. **Review results** in the unified dashboard and act.

---

## What‚Äôs Scanned

Each scan runs transparently from a developer/CI/CD perspective. You get consistent results without extra ceremony.

### SAST (Bearer)
Static analysis of your team‚Äôs source code for injection flaws, insecure patterns, and more.  
**Requirements:** none ‚Äî runs for every change.  
Engine: https://github.com/Bearer/bearer

### SCA (SBOM + OWASP Dependency-Track)
Find known vulnerabilities, licensing issues, and outdated libraries via SBOM ingestion.  
**Requirements:** place `sbom.json` in the repo root to enable SCA scans.  
Engine: https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track

### IaC (KICS)
Scan Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles and other templates for misconfigurations.  
**Requirements:** none ‚Äî runs for every change.  
Engine: https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics


Detect accidentally committed credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords) before they become incidents.  
**Requirements:** none ‚Äî runs for every change.  
Engine: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks


### Secret Leaks (gitleaks)
Detect accidentally committed credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords) before they become incidents.  
**Requirements:** none ‚Äî runs for every change.  
Engine: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks

### GitLab Repository Scanner (Mixeway ruleset)
First-class checks for **15+ GitLab repository/security misconfigurations** using our curated ruleset.

**Examples of detections:**
- No or weak **branch protection** on default branches (force-push allowed, missing approvals).
- **Unknown or untrusted runner** registered to the project/group.
- Secrets such as **passwords or tokens stored in GitLab CI/CD variables** without masking/protection.
- Insecure **merge request** settings (missing code review/approvals).
- Public exposure of private projects via **inherited visibility** or incorrect sharing.
- Missing or lax **Protected Tags** / **Protected Branches** configuration.
- **Pipeline triggers** and webhooks with overbroad permissions.
- Artifact exposure / retention misconfigurations.

**How it works:** Mixeway queries repository and project metadata, CI settings, and protection rules to evaluate policy compliance and highlight risky gaps with **actionable remediation tips**.

**Requirements:** repository access with permissions to read project settings and CI/CD configuration (token or PAT).

## AI/LLM Verification ‚Äî Under Development

We are building a complementary **AI-assisted verification layer** that operates on top of your scans to **decide if a vulnerability is actually exploitable in your codebase**. This project combines three pillars:

1. **Detected Findings**  
   Ingests and normalizes SAST, SCA (SBOM), IaC, and secret-scan outputs from Mixeway Flow.

2. **Extended Vulnerability Intelligence**  
   Enriches findings with structured threat intelligence (e.g., CVE metadata, CWE, CVSS, KEV/‚Äúknown exploited‚Äù, EPSS-like probabilities, exploit-exists signals, advisories, references).

3. **Code-Aware AI/LLM Reasoning**  
   Uses large language models and domain-specific rules to analyze **your repository‚Äôs source code** and verify whether the conditions required for exploitation are present.
    - Produces a **constraint checklist** for each vulnerability (e.g., reachable sink, untrusted data flow, missing input validation, vulnerable library version & call-site usage).
    - Maps verification to **concrete code locations** (files, functions, lines) and **execution paths**.
    - **Reduces false positives** and upgrades critical issues that meet exploitability conditions.
    - Outputs **actionable remediation** steps aligned to the exact code context.

**Outcome & Goal**
- **Target:** deliver **100% accurate and properly prioritized** results for developers and AppSec.
- **Status:** under active development; will be released as a **future version** of Mixeway Flow.
- **Early Access:** if you‚Äôre interested in testing this capability, open an issue or ping us on Discord.

> _Note:_ ‚Äú100% accurate‚Äù reflects the **design goal** for precision and prioritization in verified results; real-world performance will be transparently documented with evaluation datasets when the feature ships.

## Quick Start

> **Prereqs:** Docker Hub access + `docker-compose`

    environment:
      SSL: "TRUE"
    volumes:

    depends_on:
      - flowdb

  flowdb:
