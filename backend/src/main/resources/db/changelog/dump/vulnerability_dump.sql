17	Leakage of sensitive information in exception message	## Description\n\nLeakage of sensitive information in exception messages poses a significant security risk. When an exception message is printed to the default output, it might reveal sensitive details about your application's technical setup or environment. This could potentially open the door to attacks, such as path traversal. Even more concerning is the possibility of exposing user-specific data, which could lead to serious privacy breaches.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** print the full stack trace to the default output. This can inadvertently reveal sensitive information.\n  ```java\n  System.out.println(e); // unsafe\n  ```\n- **Do** limit error messages to only include the necessary information for understanding the issue without exposing sensitive data.\n  ```java\n  System.out.println("An error occurred. Please try again.");\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [Web Application Security Consortium: Information Leakage](http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246936/Information%20Leakage)	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/java_lang_information_leakage	2025-08-19 07:41:11.253956	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
18	Leakage of information in logger message	## Description\n\nInformation leakage through logger messages can compromise sensitive data. This vulnerability arises when dynamic data or variables, which may contain sensitive information, are included in log messages.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** include sensitive data directly in logger messages. This can lead to the exposure of such data in log files, which might be accessible to unauthorized individuals.\n  ```javascript\n  logger.info(`Results: ${data}`) // unsafe\n  ```\n- **Do** use logging levels appropriately to control the verbosity of log output and minimize the risk of leaking sensitive information in production environments.	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/javascript_lang_logger_leak	2025-08-19 07:41:13.145419	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

28	Pipeline must succeed before merging	Allowing merge requests to be merged without ensuring that the CI/CD pipeline succeeds poses a risk to code quality and stability. If the pipeline fails, it indicates that the code may contain errors, fail tests, or not meet the required standards. Merging such code can introduce bugs, regressions, or broken builds into the target branch.	\N	Check Settings > Merge requests > Merge checks > Pipelines must succeed box	2025-08-19 07:41:27.263868	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
31	Usage of insufficient random value	## Description\n\nUsing predictable random values compromises your application's security, particularly if these values serve security-related functions.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do** use a robust library for generating random values to enhance security.\n  ```javascript\n  const crypto = require('crypto');\n  crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');\n  ```	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/javascript_lang_insufficiently_random_values	2025-08-19 07:41:36.304312	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

34	Usage of hard-coded secret	## Description\n\nApplications should store secret values securely and not as literal values\nin the source code.\n\n## Remediations\n\n✅ Retrieve secrets from a secure location at runtime\n\n## Resources\n- [OWASP hardcoded passwords](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Use_of_hard-coded_password)\n- [OWASP secrets management cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#21-high-availability)\n	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/java_lang_hardcoded_secret	2025-08-19 07:42:00.569166	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
35	Missing or permissive SSL hostname verifier	## Description\n\nIt is best security practice to always verify the hostname when establishing a SSL/TLS connection. Failure to do so exposes your application to Man-in-the-Middle attacks. This vulnerability arises when the application fails to confirm that the server's hostname matches the hostname in the server's SSL certificate.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** use `ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER` or any similarly permissive hostname verifiers. These verifiers do not properly check if the server's hostname matches the SSL certificate, undermining the security of your connection.\n  ```java\n  HostnameVerifier hostnameVerifier = org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER;\n  HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier(hostnameVerifier); // unsafe\n  ```	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/java_lang_ssl_hostname_verifier	2025-08-19 07:42:00.572816	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
36	Possible CLRF injection detected	## Description\n\nCRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to insert a sequence of line termination characters into a log message. This can lead to forged log entries, compromising the integrity of log files.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do** strip any carriage return and line feed characters from user input data before logging it. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious CRLF sequences.\n  ```java\n  logger.info(userInput.replaceAll("[\\r\\n]+", ""));\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP CRLF Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CRLF_Injection)\n- [OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html)	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/java_lang_crlf_injection	2025-08-19 07:42:00.574433	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
37	Permissive cookie configuration	## Description\n\nUsing overly permissive cookie settings can expose your application to security risks, such as unauthorized access or exploits.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** set the cookie's max age to -1. This persists the cookie until the browser session ends and is a security risk.\n  ```java\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie("name", "value");\n  cookie.setMaxAge(-1); // unsafe\n  ```\n- **Do not** set the cookie's path to "/". This makes the cookie accessible to all paths in the domain. Such permissive cookie exposure is a security risk.\n  ```java\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie("name", "value");\n  cookie.setPath("/"); // unsafe\n  ```\n- **Do** set a limited maximum age for cookies to control their lifespan effectively.\n  ```java\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie("name", "value");\n  cookie.setMaxAge(3000);\n  ```\n- **Do** restrict the cookie's path to limit its accessibility to specific parts of your application. This practice enhances security by reducing the cookie's exposure.\n  ```java\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie("name", "value");\n  cookie.setPath("/my-cookie-path");\n  ```	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/java_lang_permissive_cookie_config	2025-08-19 07:42:00.575696	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
38	Unsanitized user input in logger message	## Description\n\nLogging unsanitized user input can lead to log forgery or malicious content injection. This vulnerability arises when user input is directly included in log messages without proper sanitization.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** include unsanitized user input in log messages. This can allow attackers to manipulate log files or inject harmful content.\n  ```java\n  String username = request.getParameter("username");\n  log.warn("Username is" + username); // unsafe\n  ```\n- **Do** sanitize user input before logging it. Ensure that any data derived from user input is cleaned to prevent log injection attacks.\n  ```java\n  String username = sanitized(request.getParameter("username"));\n  log.warn("Username is" + username);\n  ```\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Log Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection)\n- [OWASP logging cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html)	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/java_lang_logger	2025-08-19 07:42:00.580877	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
808	Unsanitized external input in code generation	## Description\n\nAllowing external input (dynamic or user-controlled) to directly influence code generation or scripting functions without proper sanitization can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. This occurs when an attacker is able to insert malicious code into your application, which is then executed, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data access.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** pass unsanitized external input to functions or methods that dynamically execute code.\n- **Do** always validate or sanitize input to ensure it does not contain harmful code before using it in such contexts.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Code injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection)	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/python_lang_code_injection	2025-08-19 07:54:04.418899	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

809	Unsanitized user input in 'eval' type function	## Description\n\nExecuting code with 'eval' or similar functions using unsanitized user input is risky and can lead to code injection vulnerabilities. This happens when external input is used directly in functions that execute code, allowing attackers to run malicious code within your application.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** use `eval` or similar code execution functions with unsanitized user input. This can create a significant security risk by allowing code injection.\n- **Do not** use `ast.literal_eval()` with unsanitized user input. While `literal_eval` is often considered to be less risky than `eval` because it evaluates strings as Python data structures only (integers, strings, dictionaries,etc), an attacker could exploit this function with deeply nested structures that could cause excessive memory allocation or stack consumption.\n- **Do** use dynamic hardcoded values instead of direct user input to mitigate the risk of code injection. This approach allows for controlled execution of code without exposing your application to injected malicious code. For example, use a dictionary to store functions, and call these based on user input.\n  ```python\n  def total_with_vat(a, b):\n    total = a + b\n    return total + total * 0.15\n\n  def total_without_vat(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n  get_total = {\n    "incl_vat": total_with_vat,\n    "excl_vat": total_without_vat\n  }\n\n  if form.cleaned_data["include_vat"]:\n    total_func = get_total["incl_vat"]\n    total = total_func(a, b)\n\n  # ...\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Code injection explained](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Code_Injection)	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/python_lang_eval_using_user_input	2025-08-19 07:54:04.438214	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

814	Unsanitized user input in regular expression	## Description\n\nCreating regular expressions from user input can lead to a vulnerability known as Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This issue arises because some regular expressions can be processed with exponential time complexity. When attackers exploit this, it can significantly drain CPU resources, effectively causing a denial of service.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** construct regular expressions directly from user inputs. This can make your application susceptible to ReDoS attacks.\n- **Do** consider using the `regex` module for regular expressions in Python. Unlike the `re` module, `regex` allows you to set a timeout for regular expressions to prevent excessive CPU usage. This can help mitigate the impact of potential ReDoS attacks.\n  ```python\n  regex.match(pattern, string, timeout=0.1)\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP ReDoS attacks explained](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/python_lang_regex_using_user_input	2025-08-19 07:54:04.575557	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

58	CVE-2023-45133	Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any "polyfill provider" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.	* [https://github.com/babel/babel/commit/b13376b346946e3f62fc0848c1d2a23223314c82](https://github.com/babel/babel/commit/b13376b346946e3f62fc0848c1d2a23223314c82)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/commit/b13376b346946e3f62fc0848c1d2a23223314c82](https://github.com/babel/babel/commit/b13376b346946e3f62fc0848c1d2a23223314c82)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16033](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16033)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16033](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16033)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.23.2](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.23.2)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.23.2](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.23.2)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v8.0.0-alpha.4](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v8.0.0-alpha.4)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v8.0.0-alpha.4](https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v8.0.0-alpha.4)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92](https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92)\n* [https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92](https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00026.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00026.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00026.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00026.html)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5528](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5528)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5528](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5528)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.019065	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.019337	\N

70	CVE-2023-46233	crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version 4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.	* [https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a)\n* [https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a)\n* [https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/security/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/security/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf)\n* [https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/security/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/security/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00025.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00025.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00025.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00025.html)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.058579	CRITICAL	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.058858	\N

There are patches for this issue released in versions 3.6.1 and 6.2.1.	* [https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/425e833ab13373edf1dd5a0706f07100db14e3c6](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/425e833ab13373edf1dd5a0706f07100db14e3c6)\n* [https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/425e833ab13373edf1dd5a0706f07100db14e3c6](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/425e833ab13373edf1dd5a0706f07100db14e3c6)\n* [https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/83c4071af871fc188298d7d591e95670bf9f9085](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/83c4071af871fc188298d7d591e95670bf9f9085)\n* [https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/83c4071af871fc188298d7d591e95670bf9f9085](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/83c4071af871fc188298d7d591e95670bf9f9085)\n* [https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-r7qp-cfhv-p84w](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-r7qp-cfhv-p84w)\n* [https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-r7qp-cfhv-p84w](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-r7qp-cfhv-p84w)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.080342	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.080599	\N

94	CVE-2022-29167	Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.	* [https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/pull/286](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/pull/286)\n* [https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/pull/286](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/pull/286)\n* [https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/security/advisories/GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/security/advisories/GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq)\n* [https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/security/advisories/GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq](https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/security/advisories/GHSA-44pw-h2cw-w3vq)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.115529	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.115862	\N

102	CVE-2022-46175	JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be easier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files). The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions 1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and later.	* [https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199](https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199)\n* [https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199](https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199)\n* [https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295](https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295)\n* [https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295](https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295)\n* [https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/298](https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/298)\n* [https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/298](https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/298)\n* [https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h](https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h)\n* [https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h](https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00021.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00021.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00021.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00021.html)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.133506	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.135267	\N

115	CVE-2024-4067	The NPM package `micromatch` prior to 4.0.8 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching. This issue was fixed in version 4.0.8.	* [https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CVE-2024-4067/](https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CVE-2024-4067/)\n* [https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2024-4067/](https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2024-4067/)\n* [https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2024-4067/](https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2024-4067/)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/blob/2c56a8604b68c1099e7bc0f807ce0865a339747a/index.js#L448](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/blob/2c56a8604b68c1099e7bc0f807ce0865a339747a/index.js#L448)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/commit/03aa8052171e878897eee5d7bb2ae0ae83ec2ade](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/commit/03aa8052171e878897eee5d7bb2ae0ae83ec2ade)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/issues/243](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/issues/243)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/247](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/247)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/266](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/pull/266)\n* [https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/releases/tag/4.0.8](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/releases/tag/4.0.8)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.161922	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.162204	\N

Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.	* [https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/9a3b5894f3d5d602948ac8a02e4ee528a49ca3a3](https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/9a3b5894f3d5d602948ac8a02e4ee528a49ca3a3)\n* [https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/9a3b5894f3d5d602948ac8a02e4ee528a49ca3a3](https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/9a3b5894f3d5d602948ac8a02e4ee528a49ca3a3)\n* [https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973](https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973)\n* [https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973](https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973)\n* [https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g](https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g)\n* [https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g](https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g)\n* [https://huntr.dev/bounties/f0952b67-f2ff-44a9-a9cd-99e0a87cb633/](https://huntr.dev/bounties/f0952b67-f2ff-44a9-a9cd-99e0a87cb633/)\n* [https://huntr.dev/bounties/f0952b67-f2ff-44a9-a9cd-99e0a87cb633/](https://huntr.dev/bounties/f0952b67-f2ff-44a9-a9cd-99e0a87cb633/)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IWY24RJA3SBJGA5N4CU4VBPHJPPPJL5O/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IWY24RJA3SBJGA5N4CU4VBPHJPPPJL5O/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IWY24RJA3SBJGA5N4CU4VBPHJPPPJL5O/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IWY24RJA3SBJGA5N4CU4VBPHJPPPJL5O/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZMX5YHELQVCGKKQVFXIYOTBMN23YYSRO/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZMX5YHELQVCGKKQVFXIYOTBMN23YYSRO/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZMX5YHELQVCGKKQVFXIYOTBMN23YYSRO/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZMX5YHELQVCGKKQVFXIYOTBMN23YYSRO/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221014-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221014-0003/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221014-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221014-0003/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.170014	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.170331	\N
118	CVE-2022-24785	Moment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. A path traversal vulnerability impacts npm (server) users of Moment.js between versions 1.0.1 and 2.29.1, especially if a user-provided locale string is directly used to switch moment locale. This problem is patched in 2.29.2, and the patch can be applied to all affected versions. As a workaround, sanitize the user-provided locale name before passing it to Moment.js.	* [https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/4211bfc8f15746be4019bba557e29a7ba83d54c5](https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/4211bfc8f15746be4019bba557e29a7ba83d54c5)\n* [https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/4211bfc8f15746be4019bba557e29a7ba83d54c5](https://github.com/moment/moment/commit/4211bfc8f15746be4019bba557e29a7ba83d54c5)\n* [https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-8hfj-j24r-96c4](https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-8hfj-j24r-96c4)\n* [https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-8hfj-j24r-96c4](https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-8hfj-j24r-96c4)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00035.html)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6QIO6YNLTK2T7SPKDS4JEL45FANLNC2Q/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ORJX2LF6KMPIHP6B2P6KZIVKMLE3LVJ5/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220513-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220513-0006/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220513-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220513-0006/)\n* [https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09](https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09)\n* [https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09](https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.172374	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.172562	\N

152	CVE-2021-37701	The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.	* [https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf)\n* [https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf)\n* [https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc)\n* [https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5008](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5008)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5008](https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5008)\n* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar)\n* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.3141	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.335209	\N
151	CVE-2021-32804	The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufficient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

177	CVE-2024-29180	Prior to versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk` configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL, and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to perform path traversal attack.\n\nDevelopers using `webpack-dev-server` or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the project is started, an attacker might access any file on the developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker on the local network can access the local files without any interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port).

Prior to version 5.2.1, webpack-dev-server users' source code may be stolen when they access a malicious web site. Because the request for classic script by a script tag is not subject to same origin policy, an attacker can inject a malicious script in their site and run the script.

185	CVE-2021-39227	ZRender is a lightweight graphic library providing 2d draw for Apache ECharts. In versions prior to 5.2.1, using `merge` and `clone` helper methods in the `src/core/util.ts` module results in prototype pollution. It affects the popular data visualization library Apache ECharts, which uses and exports these two methods directly. The GitHub Security Advisory page for this vulnerability contains a proof of concept. This issue is patched in ZRender version 5.2.1. One workaround is available: Check if there is `__proto__` in the object keys. Omit it before using it as an parameter in these affected methods.

264	CVE-2022-25762	If a web application sends a WebSocket message concurrently with the WebSocket connection closing when running on Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.75 or Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.20, it is possible that the application will continue to use the socket after it has been closed. The error handling triggered in this case could cause the a pooled object to be placed in the pool twice. This could result in subsequent connections using the same object concurrently which could result in data being returned to the wrong use and/or other errors.	* [https://lists.apache.org/thread/6ckmjfb1k61dyzkto9vm2k5jvt4o7w7c](https://lists.apache.org/thread/6ckmjfb1k61dyzkto9vm2k5jvt4o7w7c)\n* [https://lists.apache.org/thread/6ckmjfb1k61dyzkto9vm2k5jvt4o7w7c](https://lists.apache.org/thread/6ckmjfb1k61dyzkto9vm2k5jvt4o7w7c)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220629-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220629-0003/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220629-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220629-0003/)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html)	\N	2025-08-19 07:43:30.24609	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:43:30.24625	\N

295	Usage of unsafe Pickle libraries	## Description\n\nUsing pickle, _pickle and cPickle can make your application vulnerable to unsafe code execution. This is because the deserialization logic of these libraries allows for arbitrary code execution. It is best practices to avoid these libraries and to use a safer serialization formats like JSON.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** use pickle or its derivatives for deserialization wherever possible. These libraries are open to security vulnerabilities.\n- **Do** use recommended safer formats like JSON, Protocol Buffers (protobuf) and MessagePack.\n  ```python\n    import msgpack #MessagePack\n\n    data = {'key': 'value'}\n    packed_data = msgpack.packb(data)\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Deserialization cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/python_lang_avoid_pickle	2025-08-19 07:44:04.465349	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

301	Unpinned Actions Full Length Commit SHA	Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload.

304	CVE-2023-30861	Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.\n\n1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.\n2. The application sets `session.permanent = True`\n3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.\n4. `SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default).\n5. The application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.\n\nThis happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.	* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/70f906c51ce49c485f1d355703e9cc3386b1cc2b](https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/70f906c51ce49c485f1d355703e9cc3386b1cc2b)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/afd63b16170b7c047f5758eb910c416511e9c965](https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/afd63b16170b7c047f5758eb910c416511e9c965)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.2.5](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.2.5)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.3.2](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.3.2)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq](https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00024.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00024.html)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0006/)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5442](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5442)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/70f906c51ce49c485f1d355703e9cc3386b1cc2b](https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/70f906c51ce49c485f1d355703e9cc3386b1cc2b)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5442](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5442)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0006/)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00024.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00024.html)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq](https://github.com/pallets/flask/security/advisories/GHSA-m2qf-hxjv-5gpq)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.3.2](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.3.2)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.2.5](https://github.com/pallets/flask/releases/tag/2.2.5)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/afd63b16170b7c047f5758eb910c416511e9c965](https://github.com/pallets/flask/commit/afd63b16170b7c047f5758eb910c416511e9c965)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:17.403016	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:17.403426	\N

306	CVE-2023-23934	Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Browsers may allow "nameless" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as __Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.

307	CVE-2023-25577	Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers. Version 2.2.3 contains a patch for this issue.	* [https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/517cac5a804e8c4dc4ed038bb20dacd038e7a9f1)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/2.2.3)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-xg9f-g7g7-2323)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0003/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0003/)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5470](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5470)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5470](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5470)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:17.420001	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:17.420209	\N

312	CVE-2023-33953	gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS attacks:\n\n- Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser\n- Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser\n\nThe unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred per-input-block in the parser, and because that could be unbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop, with n selected by the client.\n\nThe unbounded memory buffering bugs:\n\n- The header size limit check was behind the string reading code, so we needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb.\n- HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0’s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC’s hpack parser needed to read all of them before concluding a parse.\n- gRPC’s metadata overflow check was performed per frame, so that the following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc…	* [https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2023-022](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2023-022)\n* [https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2023-022](https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#gcp-2023-022)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:17.429025	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:17.429164	\N

325	CVE-2023-32681	Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

328	CVE-2024-5206	A sensitive data leakage vulnerability was identified in scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, specifically in versions up to and including 1.4.1.post1, which was fixed in version 1.5.0. The vulnerability arises from the unexpected storage of all tokens present in the training data within the `stop_words_` attribute, rather than only storing the subset of tokens required for the TF-IDF technique to function. This behavior leads to the potential leakage of sensitive information, as the `stop_words_` attribute could contain tokens that were meant to be discarded and not stored, such as passwords or keys.

330	CVE-2023-25661	TensorFlow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In versions prior to 2.11.1 a malicious invalid input crashes a tensorflow model (Check Failed) and can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. A proof of concept can be constructed with the `Convolution3DTranspose` function. This Convolution3DTranspose layer is a very common API in modern neural networks. The ML models containing such vulnerable components could be deployed in ML applications or as cloud services. This failure could be potentially used to trigger a denial of service attack on ML cloud services. An attacker must have privilege to provide input to a `Convolution3DTranspose` call.

372	CVE-2022-35940	TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `RaggedRangOp` function takes an argument `limits` that is eventually used to construct a `TensorShape` as an `int64`.

423	CVE-2022-41894	TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The reference kernel of the `CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE` TensorFlow Lite operator wrongly increments the data_ptr when adding the bias to the result. Instead of `data_ptr += num_channels;` it should be `data_ptr += output_num_channels;` as if the number of input channels is different than the number of output channels, the wrong result will be returned and a buffer overflow will occur if num_channels > output_num_channels. An attacker can craft a model with a specific number of input channels. It is then possible to write specific values through the bias of the layer outside the bounds of the buffer. This attack only works if the reference kernel resolver is used in the interpreter. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 72c0bdcb25305b0b36842d746cc61d72658d2941.

The user controls the values of `input_size[i]` and `pooling_ratio_[i]` (via the `value.shape()` and `pooling_ratio` arguments). If the value in `input_size[i]` is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results in `output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode, so in released versions of TF this does not trigger.

451	CVE-2021-29531	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can trigger a `CHECK` fail in PNG encoding by providing an empty input tensor as the pixel data.

Thus, an attacker can send an empty matrix for encoding. However, if the tensor is empty, then the associated buffer is `nullptr`. Hence, when calling `png::WriteImageToBuffer`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e312e0791ce486a80c9d23110841525c6f7c3289/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/encode_png_op.cc#L79-L93), the first argument (i.e., `image.flat<T>().data()`) is `NULL`.

For string tensors, `C.TF_TString_Dealloc` is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until `NewTensor` returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

494	CVE-2021-37647	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. When a user does not supply arguments that determine a valid sparse tensor, `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset` implementation can be made to dereference a null pointer. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L240-L251) has some argument validation but fails to consider the case when either `indices` or `values` are provided for an empty sparse tensor when the other is not. If `indices` is empty, then [code that performs validation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L260-L261) (i.e., checking that the indices are monotonically increasing) results in a null pointer dereference. If `indices` as provided by the user is empty, then `indices` in the C++ code above is backed by an empty `std::vector`, hence calling `indices->dim_size(0)` results in null pointer dereferencing (same as calling `std::vector::at()` on an empty vector).

In affected versions TensorFlow allows tensor to have a large number of dimensions and each dimension can be as large as desired. However, the total number of elements in a tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would return a negative result. In the majority of TensorFlow codebase this then results in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs exist which return a `Status` instead of crashing the binary. This is similar to CVE-2021-29584. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0.

However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.	* [http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166713/Spring4Shell-Code-Execution.html](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166713/Spring4Shell-Code-Execution.html)\n* [http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166713/Spring4Shell-Code-Execution.html](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166713/Spring4Shell-Code-Execution.html)\n* [http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167011/Spring4Shell-Spring-Framework-Class-Property-Remote-Code-Execution.html](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167011/Spring4Shell-Spring-Framework-Class-Property-Remote-Code-Execution.html)\n* [http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167011/Spring4Shell-Spring-Framework-Class-Property-Remote-Code-Execution.html](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167011/Spring4Shell-Spring-Framework-Class-Property-Remote-Code-Execution.html)\n* [https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-254054.pdf](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-254054.pdf)\n* [https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-254054.pdf](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-254054.pdf)\n* [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0005](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0005)\n* [https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0005](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0005)\n* [https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965)\n* [https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965)\n* [https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67)\n* [https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67)\n* [https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/970766](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/970766)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:58.500478	CRITICAL	\N	\N	CWE-94	2025-09-07 18:06:20.576982	t

We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.	* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5b491cd5e41ad63735161cec9c2a568172c8b6a3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5b491cd5e41ad63735161cec9c2a568172c8b6a3)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5b491cd5e41ad63735161cec9c2a568172c8b6a3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5b491cd5e41ad63735161cec9c2a568172c8b6a3)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-j3mj-fhpq-qqjj](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-j3mj-fhpq-qqjj)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-j3mj-fhpq-qqjj](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-j3mj-fhpq-qqjj)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:17.991913	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:17.992054	\N
592	CVE-2022-21737	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of `*Bincount` operations allows malicious users to cause denial of service by passing in arguments which would trigger a `CHECK`-fail.

594	CVE-2022-23583	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that any binary op would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the op. In that case, calling the templated binary operator for the binary op would receive corrupted data, due to the type confusion involved. If `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and `input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly. In most cases, this would be a silent failure, but we have noticed scenarios where this results in a `CHECK` crash, hence a denial of service. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

596	CVE-2022-21731	Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The implementation of shape inference for `ConcatV2` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack via a segfault caused by a type confusion. The `axis` argument is translated into `concat_dim` in the `ConcatShapeHelper` helper function. Then, a value for `min_rank` is computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the `values` tensor has at least the required rank. However, `WithRankAtLeast` receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be represented. Due to the fact that `min_rank` is a 32-bits value and the value of `axis`, the `rank` argument is a negative value, so the error check is bypassed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.

598	CVE-2020-15213	In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment sum can trigger a denial of service by causing an out of memory allocation in the implementation of segment sum. Since code uses the last element of the tensor holding them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor, attackers can use a very large value to trigger a large allocation.

A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to limit the maximum value in the segment ids tensor. This only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model, but a similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime, between inference steps. However, if the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.	* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.007257	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.007436	\N

602	CVE-2021-37690	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions (such as `MutableHashTableShape`) produce extra output information in the form of a `ShapeAndType` struct. The shapes embedded in this struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape information, it can trigger a segfault. `ShapeRefiner` is mitigating this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will not die), but we were not doing the same for shapes and types. This commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and types. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit ee119d4a498979525046fba1c3dd3f13a039fbb1. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

623	CVE-2021-37648	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the code for `tf.raw_ops.SaveV2` does not properly validate the inputs and an attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference.

This validation would have caught the illegal state represented by the reproducer above. However, the validation uses `OP_REQUIRES` which translates to setting the `Status` object of the current `OpKernelContext` to an error status, followed by an empty `return` statement which just terminates the execution of the function it is present in. However, this does not mean that the kernel execution is finalized: instead, execution continues from the next line in `Compute` that follows the call to `ValidateInputs`. This is equivalent to lacking the validation. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9728c60e136912a12d99ca56e106b7cce7af5986. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

646	CVE-2021-37639	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read.

651	CVE-2021-37652	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed.

657	CVE-2021-37679	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions it is possible to nest a `tf.map_fn` within another `tf.map_fn` call. However, if the input tensor is a `RaggedTensor` and there is no function signature provided, code assumes the output is a fully specified tensor and fills output buffer with uninitialized contents from the heap. The `t` and `z` outputs should be identical, however this is not the case. The last row of `t` contains data from the heap which can be used to leak other memory information. The bug lies in the conversion from a `Variant` tensor to a `RaggedTensor`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_from_variant_op.cc#L177-L190) does not check that all inner shapes match and this results in the additional dimensions.

719	Usage of naive Socket class to create SSL Socket	## Description\n\nUsing the naive Socket class to create SSL sockets compromises security. Creating SSL sockets directly with `new Socket()` lacks the advanced security features provided by `SSLSocketFactory`. `SSLSocketFactory` is designed with SSL/TLS protocols in mind, offering encryption, hostname verification, and trust manager configuration. This makes it a more secure option for creating SSL sockets.\n\n## Remediations\n\n- **Do not** use `java.net.Socket` init to directly create SSL sockets, because of its limited security capabilities.\n- **Do** utilize `SSLSocketFactory` to create SSL sockets. This method ensures the use of SSL/TLS protocols and other security enhancements.\n  ```java\n  SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();\n  SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket(socket, host, port, true);\n  ```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Transport Layer Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)	\N	https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/java_lang_socket_init	2025-08-19 07:45:28.356614	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

666	CVE-2021-29614	TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory.

686	CVE-2020-15265	In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, an attacker can pass an invalid `axis` value to `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`. This results in accessing a dimension outside the rank of the input tensor in the C++ kernel implementation. However, dim_size only does a DCHECK to validate the argument and then uses it to access the corresponding element of an array. Since in normal builds, `DCHECK`-like macros are no-ops, this results in segfault and access out of bounds of the array.

691	CVE-2020-15193	In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the implementation of `dlpack.to_dlpack` can be made to use uninitialized memory resulting in further memory corruption. This is because the pybind11 glue code assumes that the argument is a tensor. However, there is nothing stopping users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor. The uninitialized memory address is due to a `reinterpret_cast` Since the `PyObject` is a Python object, not a TensorFlow Tensor, the cast to `EagerTensor` fails. The issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.	* [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html)\n* [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-rjjg-hgv6-h69v](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-rjjg-hgv6-h69v)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-rjjg-hgv6-h69v](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-rjjg-hgv6-h69v)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.239335	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.239659	\N

695	CVE-2020-15211	In TensorFlow Lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor. However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as index for these tensors. This results in special casing during validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the `-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors. Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very limited in scope. The issue is patched in several commits (46d5b0852, 00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83), and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is erro-prone, we advise upgrading to the patched code.	* [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html)\n* [http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html](http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/00302787b788c5ff04cb6f62aed5a74d936e86c0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/00302787b788c5ff04cb6f62aed5a74d936e86c0)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/00302787b788c5ff04cb6f62aed5a74d936e86c0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/00302787b788c5ff04cb6f62aed5a74d936e86c0)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1970c2158b1ffa416d159d03c3370b9a462aee35](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1970c2158b1ffa416d159d03c3370b9a462aee35)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1970c2158b1ffa416d159d03c3370b9a462aee35](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1970c2158b1ffa416d159d03c3370b9a462aee35)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/46d5b0852528ddfd614ded79bccc75589f801bd9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/46d5b0852528ddfd614ded79bccc75589f801bd9)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/46d5b0852528ddfd614ded79bccc75589f801bd9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/46d5b0852528ddfd614ded79bccc75589f801bd9)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cd31fd0ce0449a9e0f83dcad08d6ed7f1d6bef3f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cd31fd0ce0449a9e0f83dcad08d6ed7f1d6bef3f)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cd31fd0ce0449a9e0f83dcad08d6ed7f1d6bef3f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cd31fd0ce0449a9e0f83dcad08d6ed7f1d6bef3f)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e11f55585f614645b360563072ffeb5c3eeff162](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e11f55585f614645b360563072ffeb5c3eeff162)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e11f55585f614645b360563072ffeb5c3eeff162](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e11f55585f614645b360563072ffeb5c3eeff162)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fff2c8326280c07733828f990548979bdc893859](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fff2c8326280c07733828f990548979bdc893859)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fff2c8326280c07733828f990548979bdc893859](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fff2c8326280c07733828f990548979bdc893859)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cvpc-8phh-8f45](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cvpc-8phh-8f45)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cvpc-8phh-8f45](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cvpc-8phh-8f45)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.250561	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.250774	\N

708	CVE-2020-15214	In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using segment sum can trigger a write out bounds / segmentation fault if the segment ids are not sorted. Code assumes that the segment ids are in increasing order, using the last element of the tensor holding them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor. This results in allocating insufficient memory for the output tensor and in a write outside the bounds of the output array. This usually results in a segmentation fault, but depending on runtime conditions it can provide for a write gadget to be used in future memory corruption-based exploits. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that the segment ids are sorted, although this only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model. A similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime between inference steps. If the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.	* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-p2cq-cprg-frvm](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-p2cq-cprg-frvm)\n* [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-p2cq-cprg-frvm](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-p2cq-cprg-frvm)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.2938	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.29407	\N
709	CVE-2020-15202	In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the `Shard` API in TensorFlow expects the last argument to be a function taking two `int64` (i.e., `long long`) arguments. However, there are several places in TensorFlow where a lambda taking `int` or `int32` arguments is being used. In these cases, if the amount of work to be parallelized is large enough, integer truncation occurs. Depending on how the two arguments of the lambda are used, this can result in segfaults, read/write outside of heap allocated arrays, stack overflows, or data corruption.

715	CVE-2025-50181	urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Prior to 2.5.0, it is possible to disable redirects for all requests by instantiating a PoolManager and specifying retries in a way that disable redirects. By default, requests and botocore users are not affected. An application attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects at the PoolManager level will remain vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.0.	* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/f05b1329126d5be6de501f9d1e3e36738bc08857](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/f05b1329126d5be6de501f9d1e3e36738bc08857)\n* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.31177	INFO	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.311853	\N
716	CVE-2023-45803	urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`) to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.	* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/4e98d57809dacab1cbe625fddeec1a290c478ea9](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/4e98d57809dacab1cbe625fddeec1a290c478ea9)\n* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/4e98d57809dacab1cbe625fddeec1a290c478ea9](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/4e98d57809dacab1cbe625fddeec1a290c478ea9)\n* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4)\n* [https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-g4mx-q9vg-27p4)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4R2Y5XK3WALSR3FNAGN7JBYV2B343ZKB/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5F5CUBAN5XMEBVBZPHFITBLMJV5FIJJ5/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PPDPLM6UUMN55ESPQWJFLLIZY4ZKCNRX/)\n* [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get)\n* [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-get)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.313679	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:18.313802	\N

39	CVE-2024-56201	Jinja is an extensible templating engine. In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.1.5, a bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja.

40	CVE-2024-56326	Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox.

41	CVE-2025-27516	Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.6.	* [https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/90457bbf33b8662926ae65cdde4c4c32e756e403](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/90457bbf33b8662926ae65cdde4c4c32e756e403)\n* [https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-cpwx-vrp4-4pq7](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-cpwx-vrp4-4pq7)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/04/msg00045.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/04/msg00045.html)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:08.738912	INFO	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:42.895127	\N

86	CVE-2024-29041	Express.js minimalist web framework for node. Versions of Express.js prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`. The vulnerability is fixed in 4.19.2 and 5.0.0-beta.3.	* [https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location)\n* [https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94](https://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539](https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539](https://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc](https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc](https://github.com/expressjs/express/security/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc)\n* [https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800](https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800)\n* [https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800](https://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.088108	INFO	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:42.910438	\N

Versions `<= 8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the readme link will result in incorrect verification of tokens. There is a possibility of using a different algorithm and key combination in verification, other than the one that was used to sign the tokens.

All other users should upgrade to 8.0.0.	* [https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/29b96b4a1de52824e1ca0f49a701183cc4ed476f](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/29b96b4a1de52824e1ca0f49a701183cc4ed476f)\n* [https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/60f2121e9b66b7b622cc01080df0aabda9eedee6](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/commit/60f2121e9b66b7b622cc01080df0aabda9eedee6)\n* [https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/security/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/security/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250124-0001/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250124-0001/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.223837	INFO	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:42.965311	\N
89	CVE-2022-24999	qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products, allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express application because an __ proto__ key can be used. In many typical Express use cases, an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that is used to visit the application, such as a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000. The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and 6.2.4 (and therefore Express 4.17.3, which has "deps: qs@6.9.7" in its release description, is not vulnerable).	* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3](https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3)\n* [https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3](https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3)\n* [https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428](https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428)\n* [https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428](https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428)\n* [https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999](https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999)\n* [https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999](https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:42:20.093542	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:42.966694	\N

733	CVE-2024-37890	ws is an open source WebSocket client and server for Node.js. A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.	* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63](https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231](https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231](https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q](https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q)\n* [https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q](https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q)\n* [https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount)\n* [https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount)	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:35.307861	INFO	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:45:43.011205	\N

242	CVE-2023-4759	Arbitrary File Overwrite in Eclipse JGit <= 6.6.0\n\nIn Eclipse JGit, all versions <= 6.6.0.202305301015-r, a symbolic link present in a specially crafted git repository can be used to write a file to locations outside the working tree when this repository is cloned with JGit to a case-insensitive filesystem, or when a checkout from a clone of such a repository is performed on a case-insensitive filesystem.\n\nThis can happen on checkout (DirCacheCheckout), merge (ResolveMerger via its WorkingTreeUpdater), pull (PullCommand using merge), and when applying a patch (PatchApplier). This can be exploited for remote code execution (RCE), for instance if the file written outside the working tree is a git filter that gets executed on a subsequent git command.\n\nThe issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The user performing the clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git configuration.\n\nSetting git configuration option core.symlinks = false before checking out avoids the problem.\n\nThe issue was fixed in Eclipse JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available via  Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/  and  repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-releases/ . A backport is available in 5.13.3 starting from  5.13.3.202401111512-r.\n\n\nThe JGit maintainers would like to thank RyotaK for finding and reporting this issue.\n\n\n\n	* [https://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/commit/?id=9072103f3b3cf64dd12ad2949836ab98f62dabf1](https://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/commit/?id=9072103f3b3cf64dd12ad2949836ab98f62dabf1)\n* [https://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/commit/?id=9072103f3b3cf64dd12ad2949836ab98f62dabf1](https://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/commit/?id=9072103f3b3cf64dd12ad2949836ab98f62dabf1)\n* [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/11](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/11)\n* [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/11](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/11)\n* [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/6.6.1](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/6.6.1)\n* [https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/6.6.1](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/6.6.1)	\N	2025-08-19 07:43:30.165737	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:46:09.606175	\N
243	CVE-2025-4949	In Eclipse JGit versions 7.2.0.202503040940-r and older, the ManifestParser class used by the repo command and the AmazonS3 class used to implement the experimental amazons3 git transport protocol allowing to store git pack files in an Amazon S3 bucket, are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks when parsing XML files.

775	CVE-2020-8908	A temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir(). For other Java developers, we recommend migrating to the Java 7 API java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory() which explicitly configures permissions of 700, or configuring the Java runtime's java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a location whose permissions are appropriately configured.\n\n	*

234	CVE-2025-49128	Jackson-core contains core low-level incremental ("streaming") parser and generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.13.0, a flaw in jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible information disclosure in systems using pooled or reused buffers, like Netty or Vert.x. This issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via PR #652. All users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later. If upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by disabling exception message exposure to clients to avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses and/or disabling source inclusion in exceptions to prevent Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.	* [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/commit/a6c297682737dde13337cb7c3020f299518609a8](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/commit/a6c297682737dde13337cb7c3020f299518609a8)\n* [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/652)\n* [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-wf8f-6423-gfxg](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-wf8f-6423-gfxg)\n* [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-wf8f-6423-gfxg](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-wf8f-6423-gfxg)	\N	2025-08-19 07:43:29.925221	INFO	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.756417	\N
235	CVE-2025-52999	jackson-core contains core low-level incremental ("streaming") parser and generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. In versions prior to 2.15.0, if a user parses an input file and it has deeply nested data, Jackson could end up throwing a StackoverflowError if the depth is particularly large. jackson-core 2.15.0 contains a configurable limit for how deep Jackson will traverse in an input document, defaulting to an allowable depth of 1000. jackson-core will throw a StreamConstraintsException if the limit is reached. jackson-databind also benefits from this change because it uses jackson-core to parse JSON inputs. As a workaround, users should avoid parsing input files from untrusted sources.	* [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/943](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/943)\n* [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3)	\N	2025-08-19 07:43:29.926159	INFO	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.757604	\N

783	CVE-2024-6763	Eclipse Jetty is a lightweight, highly scalable, Java-based web server and Servlet engine . It includes a utility class, HttpURI, for URI/URL parsing.\n\nThe HttpURI class does insufficient validation on the authority segment of a URI.  However the behaviour of HttpURI\n differs from the common browsers in how it handles a URI that would be \nconsidered invalid if fully validated against the RRC.  Specifically HttpURI\n and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an \ninvalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may\n be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI \nis used after passing validation checks.	* [https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/pull/12012](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/pull/12012)\n* [https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-qh8g-58pp-2wxh](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-qh8g-58pp-2wxh)\n* [https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/25](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/25)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250306-0005/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250306-0005/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.795737	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:49:45.375802	\N

784	CVE-2023-40167	Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Prior to versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1, Jetty accepts the `+` character proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field.  This is more permissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely reject such requests with 400 responses.  There is no known exploit scenario, but it is conceivable that request smuggling could result if jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the connection after sending such a 400 response. Versions 9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1 contain a patch for this issue. There is no workaround as there is no known exploit scenario.	* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-hmr7-m48g-48f6](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-hmr7-m48g-48f6)\n* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-hmr7-m48g-48f6](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-hmr7-m48g-48f6)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00039.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00039.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00039.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00039.html)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5507](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5507)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5507](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5507)\n* [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6)\n* [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.6)	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.796517	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.796608	\N

785	CVE-2023-26048	Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and very large content. This happens even with the default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).	* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/9076](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/9076)\n* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/9076](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/9076)\n* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9344](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9344)\n* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9344](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9344)\n* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9345](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9345)\n* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9345](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9345)\n* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-qw69-rqj8-6qw8](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-qw69-rqj8-6qw8)\n* [https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-qw69-rqj8-6qw8](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-qw69-rqj8-6qw8)\n* [https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/blob/6.0.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/servlet-spec-body.adoc#32-file-upload](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/blob/6.0.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/servlet-spec-body.adoc#32-file-upload)\n* [https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/blob/6.0.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/servlet-spec-body.adoc#32-file-upload](https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/blob/6.0.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/servlet-spec-body.adoc#32-file-upload)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00039.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00039.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00039.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00039.html)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230526-0001/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230526-0001/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230526-0001/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230526-0001/)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5507](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5507)\n* [https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5507](https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5507)	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.797392	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.805701	\N
788	CVE-2024-31033	JJWT (aka Java JWT) through 0.12.5 ignores certain characters and thus a user might falsely conclude that they have a strong key. The impacted code is the setSigningKey() method within the DefaultJwtParser class and the signWith() method within the DefaultJwtBuilder class. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the "ignores" behavior cannot occur (in any version) unless there is a user error in how JJWT is used, and because the version that was actually tested must have been more than six years out of date.	* [https://github.com/2308652512/JJWT_BUG](https://github.com/2308652512/JJWT_BUG)\n* [https://github.com/2308652512/JJWT_BUG](https://github.com/2308652512/JJWT_BUG)\n* [https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt)\n* [https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt)\n* [https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/930#issuecomment-2032699358](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/930#issuecomment-2032699358)\n* [https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/930#issuecomment-2032699358](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/930#issuecomment-2032699358)\n* [https://www.viralpatel.net/java-create-validate-jwt-token/](https://www.viralpatel.net/java-create-validate-jwt-token/)\n* [https://www.viralpatel.net/java-create-validate-jwt-token/](https://www.viralpatel.net/java-create-validate-jwt-token/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.816808	INFO	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.816938	\N

789	CVE-2022-36033	jsoup is a Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning, scraping, and cross-site scripting (XSS) safety. jsoup may incorrectly sanitize HTML including `javascript:` URL expressions, which could allow XSS attacks when a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version. To remediate this issue without immediately upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)	* [https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.15.3](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.15.3)\n* [https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.15.3](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.15.3)\n* [https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369)\n* [https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369)\n* [https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.3](https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.3)\n* [https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.3](https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.3)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0006/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0006/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0006/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.826466	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.826599	\N
790	CVE-2021-37714	jsoup is a Java library for working with HTML. Those using jsoup versions prior to 1.14.2 to parse untrusted HTML or XML may be vulnerable to DOS attacks. If the parser is run on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to get stuck (loop indefinitely until cancelled), to complete more slowly than usual, or to throw an unexpected exception. This effect may support a denial of service attack. The issue is patched in version 1.14.2. There are a few available workarounds. Users may rate limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on system resources, and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes.	*

241	CVE-2020-15250	In JUnit4 from version 4.7 and before 4.13.1, the test rule TemporaryFolder contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder, and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other untrusted users. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you must use the workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will fix this vulnerability. For more information, including an example of vulnerable code, see the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.	*

791	CVE-2022-41946	pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. In affected versions a prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.0. Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will mitigate this vulnerability.	* [https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/9008dc9aade6dbfe4efafcd6872ebc55f4699cf5](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/9008dc9aade6dbfe4efafcd6872ebc55f4699cf5)\n* [https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/9008dc9aade6dbfe4efafcd6872ebc55f4699cf5](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/9008dc9aade6dbfe4efafcd6872ebc55f4699cf5)\n* [https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h)\n* [https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-562r-vg33-8x8h)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00003.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00003.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00003.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00003.html)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/25TY2L3RMVNOC7VAHJEAO7PTT6M6JJAD/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/25TY2L3RMVNOC7VAHJEAO7PTT6M6JJAD/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/25TY2L3RMVNOC7VAHJEAO7PTT6M6JJAD/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/25TY2L3RMVNOC7VAHJEAO7PTT6M6JJAD/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0003/)\n* [https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0003/](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0003/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.839987	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.840078	\N
792	CVE-2022-31197	PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (PgJDBC for short) allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent Java code. The PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user. User applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted. User application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet. Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user. Patched versions will be released as `42.2.26` and `42.4.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.	* [https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/739e599d52ad80f8dcd6efedc6157859b1a9d637](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/739e599d52ad80f8dcd6efedc6157859b1a9d637)\n* [https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/739e599d52ad80f8dcd6efedc6157859b1a9d637](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/739e599d52ad80f8dcd6efedc6157859b1a9d637)\n* [https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2)\n* [https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-r38f-c4h4-hqq2)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00009.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00009.html)\n* [https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00009.html](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00009.html)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I6WHUADTZBBQLVHO4YG4XCWDGWBT4LRP/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I6WHUADTZBBQLVHO4YG4XCWDGWBT4LRP/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I6WHUADTZBBQLVHO4YG4XCWDGWBT4LRP/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I6WHUADTZBBQLVHO4YG4XCWDGWBT4LRP/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UTFE6SV33P5YYU2GNTQZQKQRVR3GYE4S/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UTFE6SV33P5YYU2GNTQZQKQRVR3GYE4S/)\n* [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UTFE6SV33P5YYU2GNTQZQKQRVR3GYE4S/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UTFE6SV33P5YYU2GNTQZQKQRVR3GYE4S/)	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.840928	HIGH	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.841013	\N

797	CVE-2022-21724	pgjdbc is the offical PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. A security hole was found in the jdbc driver for postgresql database while doing security research. The system using the postgresql library will be attacked when attacker control the jdbc url or properties. pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided via `authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties.

261	CVE-2020-5397	Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.3 are vulnerable to CSRF attacks through CORS preflight requests that target Spring MVC (spring-webmvc module) or Spring WebFlux (spring-webflux module) endpoints. Only non-authenticated endpoints are vulnerable because preflight requests should not include credentials and therefore requests should fail authentication. However a notable exception to this are Chrome based browsers when using client certificates for authentication since Chrome sends TLS client certificates in CORS preflight requests in violation of spec requirements. No HTTP body can be sent or received as a result of this attack.	* [https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2020-5397](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2020-5397)\n* [https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2020-5397](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2020-5397)\n* [https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html](https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html](https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html)\n* [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html)	\N	2025-08-19 07:43:30.241171	MEDIUM	\N	\N	\N	2025-08-19 07:47:15.895478	\N
